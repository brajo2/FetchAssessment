# FetchAssessment
Interesting &amp; challenging assessment from Fetch, built around data wrangling, relational modeling and preliminary analysis for a set of JSON files.

There's C# within this project (mostly for just committing data to my ad-hoc PostgreSQL database).
There's also an R Markdown with the bulk of the information, which I formatted as a word document, but it could easily have been an HTML document.
